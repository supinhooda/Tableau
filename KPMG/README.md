# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program
Data Analytics with big data and production of business results with the KPMG data analytics team.

### Tools Required: Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Word, Python Data Analysis Library, Python Data Visualization Library.

1) Data Quality Assesment - Using Microsoft Excel and Data Analysis tools.

   APPROACH : I made use of various tools in MS Excel ( most notably: filter, Data validation, Duplicate removal, Conversion of data types) , found inconsistent data,missing values, unecessary data and noisy data. I framed my findings and mitigations for the Data Quality to the client on MS Word.
2) Data Insights - Feature Engineering with the help of external resources like: Census, Regional Postcodes, Data Exploration by visualising data, Model Development after Data Preprocessing, and communication of high resource customers after Interpretation.

   APPROACH : I made use of Google Colab and packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy for Data Exploration + insights and Interpretation by Data Visualization. Strong                  analysis of data was done by merging datasets based on similar attributes, resetting indexes, Normalizing data, Data preprocessing, Feature engineering such as
             deriving age from DOB provided, making use of postcodes and area to come to the conclusion if the area is regional or not which may lead to maximum profits for the bike
             company. 
             Finally, data insights were communicated to prospective client using Data Visualization and Communication via a powerpoint presentation which focused on visual
             understanding of data along with qualitiative and quantitative findings from data exploration.
3) Data Insights and Visualization - Creation of a Dashboard communicating the data analysis plan to the Client using Tableau/PowerBI software.

    APPROACH: I used Tableau to create an interactive Dashboard with 3 tabs depicting the effect of the attributes Age, Gender, Wealth Segment, Job Industry, Car, State ad their correlations, on Bike related purchases using Data Visualization techniques.
