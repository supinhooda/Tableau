## Tasks

### Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario

Learned how to anticipate the questions, the business leaders will need answers to.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled and we need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Eight (8) questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO)

### Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals

Learned which visuals are most effective in a given scenario and Chose the right charts based on needs such as Comparison, Distribution, Relationship, and Composition.

### Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals

We would need to provide insights that they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyze the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

We would need to make sure that the data we are using is of good quality and does not contain any bad data that would have an adverse impact on our analysis. Once the data is cleaned, the next step would be to create the visuals on Tableau.

The Questions for this visuals were:- 

Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested in viewing the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights into the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis

Develop a script and record a video presenting your findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals you created in the previous tasks and Effectively communicating the findings and explaining how they relate to each scenario in a business-friendly language.
